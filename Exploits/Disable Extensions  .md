### LTMEAT | Disable extensions 
1. Get your extension's id that you want to disable by going to `chrome://extensions`
2. Click on the "Details" button on the extension you want to disable
3. On the URL in the search bar, you find something like this: `chrome://extensions/?id=odoanpnonilogofggaohhkdkdgbhdljp`
4. Get the 32 character lowercase string after the ?id=, this will be your id. So for this example, the id is: `odoanpnonilogofggaohhkdkdgbhdljp`
5. Substitute the id for this url: ```chrome-extension://EXTENSIONIDHERE/manifest.json```, so the example would now be chrome-extension://odoanpnonilogofggaohhkdkdgbhdljp/manifest.json
6. Go to the url you just created on another tab, you'll see a bunch of code and stuff.
7. Bookmark the page you just opened (called it "A") if you wish, if the bookmarks aren't visible, press `ctrl shift b`. 
8. Then, bookmark `chrome://kill` (B) and `chrome://hang` (C) right clicking on the bookmarks bar, adding a page, replacing the name with something memorable, and replacing the URL with the command.
9. On the extension page (A), click the `chrome://kill` bookmark (B). The page should crash. You should already have the next step prepared. 
10. Instantly start spam clicking the `chrome://hang` (bookmark C) and quickly reload the page while spamming (press the refresh key on your keyboard, above the number 4 or `ctrl`+`R`). You should have reloaded within one or two seconds of killing the page. 
11. If the extension page (bookmark A) no longer loads, then LTMEAT worked! You can cloes the tabs now. If nothing loads, you probably reloaded too late or spammed too slowly.
12. Restart your computer to go back to normal.

### LTMEAT Flood | Disable extensions 
A simpler tutorial: (use proxy if needed)`https://chrose.netlify.app/detail/ltmeat%20flood/` <br>
1. Create a bookmark folder and paste the extension page (go to LTMEAT steps 1-5 to get the extension page, make sure it ends with manifest.json) many times. (800 minimum is the usual) You should add the extension settings page (e.g. `chrome://extensions/?id=odoanpnonilogofggaohhkdkdgbhdljp`) at the start of the folder.
2. Right-click the folder and open all in a new window.
3. Close the window with all those tabs after they appear.
4. Open the folder in a new window again, and Chrome should hang (forever reloading) those tabs 
5. Flip the `Allow access to file URLs` switch in the extension settings, and then you've bypassed the patch, and the exploit is working (you can close the tabs now).

**Not working?** Ensure you open a large set, but not too large, of extension tabs (`_/generated_background_page.html` or `/manifest.json`) for a permanent freeze. <br> If your chromebook restarts or shuts down during step 2, lessen the number of pages in the folder, vice versa for increasing the tabs.

### LTMEAT PRINT | Disable extensions 
1. Go to the extension page that has all the code in it (LTMEAT steps 1-5). and hit Ctrl+P. A print window should show up with a number of pages in the top right.
2. Do everything you can to increase that number. Shrink down margins, increase scale, change layout to landscape, anything you can.
The higher you can get that number, the longer the effect will last. 
3. Hit reload (above the button 4). The page should start hanging.
4. Go to your extension's settings page (e.g. `chrome://extensions/?id=odoanpnonilogofggaohhkdkdgbhdljp`).
5. Duplicate your printing tab (right click and press duplicate) and go back to your extension's settings page.
6. Flip the `Allow Access to file URLS` switch.

### Dextensify | Temporarily disables extensions | credit: ading2210
Directions: Go to any of the following links and follow the directions below the links.
Links: 
- https://dextensify.pages.dev/main 
- [this](https://github.com/wea-f/ByePassHub/blob/main/Exploits/DextensifyDataURL) data url file
- Download the code from his [repo](https://github.com/ading2210/dextensify) and open the downloaded file
1. Go to `chrome://extensions` and click on the extension you want to disable
2. On one of the links above, press "freeze extension"
3. Switch back to the your tab from step 1
4. Repeatedly click the "Allow Access to File URLs" switch for a few seconds.
5. The extension should be disabled
6. However after a few minutes you may find that it is enabled back again, if so, click the dextensify tab, then go to the extension settings tab to repeat step 4.

### Corkey | Corrupt extensions (disable them) 
CAUTION! Performing this exploit will erase your local data including everything in "My Files." Make sure to back up your data to your drive.
1. Do Esc + Refresh + Power on your chromebook and re-enroll (Enter recovery page) or you can just powerwash.
2. Log into your Chromebook and immediately turn off WiFi and do refresh button + power button too (instant restart).
3. Log back into your Chromebook with the WiFi off. Click the option to log in as an existing user.
4. Go to chrome://extensions, turn on WiFi, and wait for your school's blocking extension to appear.
5. As soon as it appears, turn off WiFi and restart (refresh + power) as fast as possible.
6. Log back in, go back to extensions, and wait. If it says your blocking extension could be corrupted 
or doesn't appear at all, then it worked (wait at least a minute in case if it comes back)
7. If it didn't work, start over. You have to be fast.
