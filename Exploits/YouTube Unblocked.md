### Unblocked Youtube Videos
1. **Copy the youtube video link** you want to watch. To find a video, search one on Google or go to `https://socialblade.com` and find a youtuber you want to watch.
2. Paste the link in a new tab, don't enter it yet.
3. Notice the format of the link, it could be `https://youtube.com/watch?v=SOMERANDOMCHARACTERS` or `https://youtu.be/SOMERANDOMCHARACTERS` or something entirely different.
4. You have to **find the video's id** (a 11 character string, specific to the video), so by deleting the `youtube.com/watch?v=` part, you are left with the video id. <br> For example, I have this link `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ` <br> To get the id, delete the `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=` part of the link. <br> Now I have the video ID, which is `dQw4w9WgXcQ`
5. If you don't have the `https://youtube.com/watch?v=` format, try to locate the 11 character video ID, remember it is completely random for every video, and it contains capital letters and lowercase ones too.
6. Now you got the video id, **substitute it** for this link `https://youtube.com/embed/VIDEOIDHERE`
7. Following my example, the link should now be `https://youtube.com/embed/dQw4w9WgXcQ`
8. Paste this link on another tab and go to it. **If it is blocked, try this link instead,** `https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/VIDEOIDHERE`
